Mahalabia.
You start by adding whole milk, corn starch OR rice flour, and sugar in a pot and whisking everything together until the corn starch/rice flour is dissolved
Then you add the cream (which is optional) and whisk over medium heat continuously for about 10 minutes until the mixture has thickened to a pudding consistency
You then add a bit of cardamom, orange blossom water or rose water per preference
You pour it into serving cups (you can do one big dish as well), pop in the fridge to cool for at least a few hours, garnish with nuts when ready to serve and enjoy!
